"Candidate" version clean up for public release

** V00-00-02  [Fri Jan 13 00:18:48 2006]
Fixed CMSKtJetAlgorithm.cc so it now works with the new CaloTower implementation. Discovered Kt algorithm only successfully clusters 2 or more towers: fails to cluster TB events with single pions putting energy in a single tower. Caveat Emptor!

** V00-00-01  [Fri Oct 28 03:35:37 2005]
Correct name of preprocessor header guard in JetableObjectHelper.h.
